# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Pandemic Simulator

A sophisticated agent-based model that simulates pandemic dynamics through independent reinforcement learning agents. This project models how individuals with diverse beliefs and preferences adapt their health behaviors during a pandemic.

This simulator uses Q-learning to model how 100 independent agents learn optimal strategies for navigating a pandemic environment through:

- Mask wearing behaviors
- Vaccination decisions
- Social distancing practices

Each agent has unique personality traits and beliefs that influence their decisions and learning processes, creating a realistic simulation of diverse societal responses to pandemic policies.
